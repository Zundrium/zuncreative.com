The AI Photobooth is an innovative system capable of generating unique, personalized images using artificial intelligence. It can operate either standalone, through local processing, or via a cloud-based architecture, allowing for flexibility in implementation. The system delivers compact images that can be printed immediately after generation, providing a fast and interactive user experience.

A key feature of the AI Photobooth is the integration of 'Virtual Try-On' technology. This allows users to virtually try on clothing or accessories, which are then integrated into the generated image. This application enriches the interaction and provides a playful and personalized output.

The technological foundation of the AI Photobooth is designed to leverage the latest AI developments. The system is supported by the ComfyUI platform, which enables the implementation of advanced generative models and workflows, thereby contributing to the quality and uniqueness of the produced images.
