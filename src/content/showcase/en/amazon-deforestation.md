Sometimes you hear impressive facts, like '150 billion animals are slaughtered every year,' and you think, 'What does that really mean?' It's hard to imagine such large numbers.

This project takes a different approach. We have developed a real-time 3D web experience that shows exactly what is happening in the world, for example, with deforestation in the Amazon. Instead of just presenting a number, you see the consequences continuously and directly on screen.

The idea is simple: by using an animation that visualizes the impact live, you get a much better grasp of the enormous scale of these kinds of global problems. It makes the abstract concrete and tangible, so you truly understand what's at stake.
