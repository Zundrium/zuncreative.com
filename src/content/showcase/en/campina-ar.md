This project involved the development of a web-augmented reality (AR) experience. It was realized using the ZappAR platform, which made it accessible to end-users via a web browser.

Central to the experience was the communication of Campina's sustainability practices. This was supported by the presentation of relevant facts and figures to substantiate the sustainable aspects of the product.

A significant part of the experience was a presenter, recorded using greenscreen technology. This presenter verbally explained the content and key messages of the AR experience.

To reach a broader audience, the experience was designed to be multilingual. Specifically, a French version was implemented, with a separate speaker presenting the content for this specific target audience.
