The development of the web-augmented reality (AR) experience was implemented using the 8th Wall platform. This technology made it possible to offer a high-quality AR experience directly through the web browser, without the need to download a specific application.

The entire AR experience was centered around the official opening of a new Carport location in Rotterdam. This digital application served as an innovative supplement to the introduction of this facility.

A key element of the experience was the presentation given by Robert Doornbos. This presentation used 3D live mesh technology, which offered an interactive and progressive way of communicating.

After the initial presentation, users had the opportunity to experience an augmented reality (AR) viewing of the new building. This virtual tour provided a detailed insight into the architecture and layout of the new location.
