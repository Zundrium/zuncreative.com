This project was a demonstration of a concept for an interactive business card, based on a 3D 'walk-in' environment. The core of this demonstration lay in the integration of AI-generated content.

Specifically, AI textures were used for the visual dressing of the scene, resulting in unique and atmospheric surfaces within the tunnel. Additionally, AI-generated music was used to complement the auditory experience. The 3D environment was designed as a 'walkable' tunnel, enriched with specific sound effects that enhanced immersion. This project demonstrated how such technologies can contribute to a dynamic and integrated digital experience.
