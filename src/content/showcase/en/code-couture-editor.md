The 'Code Couture Editor' is an application that enables the procedural generation of virtual garments. Its functionality is based on the use of a procedural shader, allowing for the creation of an unlimited number of unique clothing items.

On the right side of the interface, there is a series of sliders that allow the user to manipulate various parameters. These parameters include color, pattern thickness, and design symmetry, providing extensive control over the final visual result.

This editor was used as part of an exhibition at the Design Museum Den Bosch, where it allowed visitors to experience the possibilities of procedural design in digital textile creation.
