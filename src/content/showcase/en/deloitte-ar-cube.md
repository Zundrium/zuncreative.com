This project involved the creation of a web-augmented reality (AR) experience, developed using the ZappAR platform. This choice made it possible to make the application directly accessible to users via a web browser, without the need for a separate app download.

The core of the experience is based on advanced image tracking technology, applied to a physical cube. This technique facilitates a cinematic presentation, where interactions with the cube generate a dynamic and visually appealing digital content experience.

For the accessibility of this AR experience, a user-friendly activation mechanism was implemented. By scanning a QR code placed directly on the cube, the experience is seamlessly opened on the user's mobile device.
