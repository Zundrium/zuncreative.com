This project involved the implementation of an augmented reality (AR) experience, realized using the 8th Wall platform. This technology made it possible to offer the New Year's speech as a web-AR application, facilitating direct access via regular web browser interfaces.

Greenscreen technology was used for the presentation, marking the first application of this method within this type of communication for the organization. This made it possible to place the speaker in a dynamic and virtual environment, despite physical limitations.

The digital execution of the New Year's speech was a direct response to the limitations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Since physical social events were not possible, this virtual presentation offered an alternative to ensure and continue the annual tradition of the New Year's address.
