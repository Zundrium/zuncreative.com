This demonstration was specifically developed to illustrate the effectiveness of recent texture compression techniques. The project shows that it is possible to reduce the file size of a complete, interactive 3D exhibition to just 9MB while maintaining visual quality. For comparison, the usual file size for such 3D environments is often around 50MB.

The applied optimization methods result in significantly shorter loading times compared to alternative solutions. Furthermore, the demo is designed to function seamlessly on mobile devices, ensuring broad accessibility and an optimal user experience, regardless of the platform used.
