This project involved the development of an augmented reality (AR) experience, realized via the 8th Wall platform. This technology made it possible to create a direct and interactive virtual meeting, accessible directly through a web browser.

The presentation by Lilian Marijnissen, leader of the Socialist Party, was created using greenscreen technology. This approach facilitated dynamic and direct communication, allowing her to convey her message in a virtual environment.

The implementation of this digital communication was a direct response to the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which made physical social events impossible. This virtual format enabled the party to share crucial information and current standpoints timely and broadly with its supporters and the public.

Within this virtual setting, Lilian Marijnissen provided insight into the most current and relevant policy issues. The content was specifically aimed at clarifying the intentions and vision of the SP, and how these align with the expectations and interests of the public.
