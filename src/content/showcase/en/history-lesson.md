A quick history lesson, but completely different! This 3D scene delves into how the Romans used to dine. The cool thing is that we use real-time lighting here, and yes, it works super smoothly on your phone too.

By doing this, we try to let the user truly taste the atmosphere of the past and see the Romans in their own environment. It's a much more vivid way of learning than from a book. And it's precisely such experiences that stick with you much better! It immediately triggers you to go on a discovery tour yourself and examine every detail in the room.
