This project involved the development of an augmented reality (AR) application, designed to place virtual billboards of the Socialist Party (SP) in the user's physical environment. The primary implementation of this web-AR functionality was done using the 8th Wall platform, which allowed direct access via standard web browsers.

For broader distribution and integration within social media applications, the filter was also developed with Spark AR Studio. This combined approach resulted in an innovative and interactive means to digitally communicate the party's visual identity and message and to stimulate public engagement.

This digital campaign served as a strategic adaptation, especially in situations where traditional physical advertising means or public events were limited. It offered a flexible and interactive method to make the party's message consistently and prominently visible to a wide audience.
