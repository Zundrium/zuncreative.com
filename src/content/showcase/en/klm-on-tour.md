This project involved the development of an augmented reality (AR) experience, specifically designed for KLM, and implemented using the 8th Wall platform. The core of this experience was a greenscreen presentation, where a virtual host guided the user directly within the interactive environment.

Within the experience, users could interact intuitively by physically navigating between different virtual suitcases. This interaction was enriched with various dynamic elements, contributing to an engaging and immersive experience.

The process was accompanied by a gamified element, where selecting the correct suitcase offered the chance to win a prize in the form of a 'golden ticket'. This served as an incentive for active participation and resulted in a memorable brand experience for the participants.
