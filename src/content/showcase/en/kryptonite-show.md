The 'Kryptonite Show' is a 3D web application that offers a visual experience based on an AI-driven podcast and the theme of a specific cryptocurrency.

The primary development goal was to create the most cinematic tour possible through the virtual environment. This involved a focus on dynamic camera work, atmospheric rendering, and a narrative structure that immerses the user in the theme, visually supporting and enriching the content of the AI podcast.
