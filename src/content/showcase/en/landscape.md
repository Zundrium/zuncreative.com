This 'proof of concept' demonstrates an innovative approach to web navigation. Instead of the traditional page structure, the user is guided through a three-dimensional environment. Navigation occurs by moving sideways and selecting specific objects.

The camera moves to predefined points in the 3D space, creating an intuitive and immersive browsing experience. This method gives the webpage an adventurous character and offers an alternative to linear navigation patterns.
