**Medidate** is a conceptual meditation app born from a personal need: the desire to take short, distraction-free breaks without being pushed into subscriptions or sign-ups. While most meditation apps focus on upselling or freemium models, *Medidate* offers a simpler alternative—calm, direct, and immediately accessible.

The app provides a visually minimal interface with a timer and a selection of ambient sounds such as rain, wind, birds, and more. Users can mix these freely to create their own atmosphere and begin meditating within seconds.

Visually, the experience is enhanced by **AI-generated images** (via OpenAI) featuring transparent layers, creating a layered parallax effect. Technically, it’s powered by **Astro** as the framework, **Lenis** for smooth scrolling, and **GSAP** for subtle transitions and animations.

Optimized for mobile, the concept aims to provide a quiet, intuitive experience—free from noise, both literally and digitally.
