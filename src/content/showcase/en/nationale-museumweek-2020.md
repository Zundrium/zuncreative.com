As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many social events were forced to be canceled. The organization of the National Museum Week faced the challenge of developing an online alternative to present artworks from more than 400 Dutch museums.

The solution was found in the creation of a three-dimensional virtual representation of Amsterdam's Museumplein, the location where the event would normally take place. This digital environment served as a platform to virtually exhibit the collections of various museums, thus offering an alternative experience for the public.
