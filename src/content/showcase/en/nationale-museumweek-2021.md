Just as in 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the cancellation of physical social events. For the National Museum Week 2021, it was therefore also necessary to develop an alternative to show artworks from more than 400 Dutch museums to the public.

Once again, a three-dimensional virtual representation of Amsterdam's Museumplein, the usual physical location of the event, was chosen as the platform for this digital edition. This enabled the museums to present their collections virtually and offer the public an accessible experience.
