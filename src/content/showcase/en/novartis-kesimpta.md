This project involved the development of an augmented reality (AR) application for Novartis Kesimpta, realized via the ZappAR platform. The choice of this platform made it possible to make the experience directly accessible via a web browser, which minimized entry barriers and facilitated wide distribution among medical professionals without the need for app downloads.

The primary goal of this AR experience was to efficiently and memorably instruct medical professionals on the correct use of a new medication. Given the complexity of pharmaceutical instructions, this format offered an innovative and interactive approach to conveying procedural information in a clear and retention-promoting manner.

The methodology involved using a set of physical cards that acted as individual triggers for various augmented reality presentations. Through image tracking technology, each card activated a specific AR module, allowing different aspects of the medication administration to be demonstrated step-by-step and hands-on. This modular setup provided a targeted and highly effective learning experience.
