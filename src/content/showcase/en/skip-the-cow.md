This project, titled 'Skip the Cow,' was developed for Upfield for the internal promotion of Flora Plant Butter. Its goal was to communicate the benefits of this plant-based product over traditional dairy butter in an innovative and interactive way, using augmented reality (AR) technology directly accessible via a QR code.

The core of the experience was centered around a playful yet powerful narrative: 'Skip the Cow, not the taste.' After activation via a QR code, users navigated a virtual space with an initial scene consisting of a cow next to a package of Flora Plant Butter. An intuitive interaction, where the user could 'swipe away' the virtual cow, initiated a transformative animation. This action resulted in the cow disappearing and the simultaneous growth of a green, plant-based frame around the butter package, prominently displaying Flora's campaign presentation.

To further deepen the product message and strengthen internal engagement, additional interactive elements were integrated into the AR environment. On one side, visually appealing recipes were displayed, highlighting the culinary versatility and taste of Flora Plant Butter. On the other side, relevant statistics were presented on the positive impact of plant-based food choices on sustainability, underscoring the broader ecological benefits of the product. This layered approach ensured an informative, interactive, and memorable experience that effectively conveyed the core message.
