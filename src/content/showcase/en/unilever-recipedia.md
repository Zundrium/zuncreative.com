This project, titled 'Unilever Recipedia,' involved the development of an augmented reality (AR) solution, realized using the ZappAR platform. This choice facilitated a web-augmented reality (web-AR) experience, directly accessible via a web browser, which significantly lowered the barrier to adoption and improved user-friendliness.

As a proof of concept (PoC), this project aimed to investigate how complex recipe information could be efficiently and quickly absorbed by the user (within 20 seconds). This addressed the need for rapid, visually appealing information transfer in an era of limited attention spans, specifically within the culinary context.

The experience began with a short, animated visualization that concisely presented the essential ingredients and crucial steps of the recipe. Following this, a digital card was projected in AR, offering a complete and detailed summary of the entire recipe. This two-pronged approach combined a quick initial visual overview with the option for in-depth information, optimizing for both speed and completeness of information delivery.
