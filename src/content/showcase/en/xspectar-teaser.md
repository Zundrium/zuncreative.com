xSpectar is a project centered around the NFT and Web3.0 ecosystems. It features its own cryptocurrency network with a token called $XSPECTAR, which is based on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network.

The realization of this project was made possible by the efforts of a multidisciplinary 3D artist team. To meet tight deadlines, the workflow was optimized by pre-assigning specific camera positions and shots to individual team members.
